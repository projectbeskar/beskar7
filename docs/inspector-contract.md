# Beskar7 Controller ↔ Inspector Contract

**Contract version: `v2`**

This document is the single source of truth for the wire contract between the
Beskar7 controller (`github.com/projectbeskar/beskar7`) and the inspection
ramdisk (`beskar7-inspector`). Both repositories pin to a contract version; a
change to the wire format, auth, endpoints, or cmdline parameters is a contract
version bump and requires updating this document and the golden fixture
(see [Versioning and anti-drift](#versioning-and-anti-drift)).

> **v2 in one line:** the inspector no longer `kexec`s into a kernel+initrd. It
> writes a complete Kairos whole-disk image to the target disk, injects the
> per-host config (carrying CAPI bootstrap user-data) into the image's
> `COS_OEM` partition, and reboots the host into the provisioned OS. The
> inspection report schema (§6) is **unchanged** from v1. See
> [Version history](#101-version-history) for the full delta.

Requirement keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY) are used per RFC 2119.

## 1. Scope and audience

This contract covers the network boot, hardware-inspection, bootstrap-data
handoff, and OS deployment between a freshly PXE-booted bare-metal host running
the inspector and the Beskar7 controller's callback server. It does **not**
cover Redfish/BMC control (the controller↔BMC channel) or the operator's
DHCP/TFTP/HTTP boot infrastructure, except where that infrastructure carries
contract material (the boot nonce — see §4). It also does **not** cover the
serving of the target OS image itself (an operator-hosted artifact reachable at
`beskar7.target`); the contract governs only how the inspector locates,
integrity-checks, and applies it (§8.1, §9).

Audience: implementers of the inspector, implementers of the controller's
callback + boot endpoints, and operators wiring the provisioning network.

---

## 2. Provisioning sequence

```
Beskar7Machine reconcile (controller)
  ├─ claim PhysicalHost (ConsumerRef) → host StateInUse
  ├─ triggerInspection:
  │    ├─ mint bearer token  → hash on Status.Bootstrap.TokenHash, plaintext in Secret
  │    ├─ mint boot nonce    → hash on Status.Bootstrap.BootNonceHash, plaintext in Secret
  │    └─ Redfish SetBootSourcePXE + power on
  │
operator DHCP/boot-infra (NOT Beskar7)
  └─ host PXE-boots → chainloads per-host iPXE script (keyed by MAC) over HTTPS,
        whose URL embeds the boot nonce: GET {api}/api/v1/boot/{ns}/{host}/{nonce}
  │
controller /boot endpoint (nonce-gated, NOT bearer-gated)
  └─ verify nonce → consume (single-use) → render kernel cmdline:
        beskar7.api / beskar7.namespace / beskar7.host / beskar7.token
        / beskar7.target / beskar7.target-digest / beskar7.ca
  │
inspector ramdisk (on the host) — Phase 1: enroll & inspect (always)
  ├─ probe hardware (native SMBIOS/DMI + /sys + /proc)
  ├─ select target disk
  └─ POST report  → {api}/api/v1/inspection/{ns}/{host}   (Bearer token, TLS-verified)  → 202
  │
inspector ramdisk — Phase 2: provision (when bootstrap data is available)
  ├─ GET bootstrap → {api}/api/v1/bootstrap/{ns}/{host}    (Bearer token, TLS-verified)  → user-data
  ├─ download beskar7.target (plain HTTP) → verify sha256 == beskar7.target-digest
  ├─ write the whole-disk image to the selected target disk (dd-equivalent)
  ├─ re-read the partition table; mount the image's COS_OEM partition
  ├─ inject a per-host cloud-config embedding the fetched user-data into COS_OEM
  └─ sync, unmount, reboot(2) → host firmware boots the provisioned OS
  │
controller
  └─ host → StateReady, Beskar7Machine.Spec.ProviderID set, Ready=true
```

**Success signal is out-of-band.** The inspector reboots and is gone before the OS
finishes booting; it does **not** report "provisioning succeeded" — no such
callback exists in this contract, by design. The final controller-side transition
(`StateReady` / `ProviderID` / `Ready=true`) is driven by inspection completing,
and the *real* proof the host provisioned correctly is the node registering with
the management cluster via the injected join secret (CAPI's normal node-join path,
matching the Metal³ posture). A host-reported provisioning-success/liveness signal
is explicitly **out of scope** for v2 (see §11).

---

## 3. Trust model (overview)

Two distinct per-host secrets, by design (decision D-009). Do not conflate them.

| Secret | Gates | Lifetime | Reuse | Delivered to host via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Boot nonce** | `GET /api/v1/boot/...` | ~10 min | **single-use** | the operator's iPXE script URL (the nonce IS the capability) |
| **Bearer token** | `POST /inspection`, `GET /bootstrap` | 30 min (`auth.TokenLifetime`) | multi-use | rendered into the kernel cmdline by `/boot` |

The booting host holds no bearer token, so the endpoint that *hands out* the
bearer token (`/boot`) cannot itself be bearer-gated. The boot nonce breaks that
chicken-and-egg: possession of an unguessable 256-bit nonce — not a spoofable
MAC and not network placement — is the authorization to receive the bearer
token + boot parameters.

Both secrets are minted with `crypto/rand` and stored hashed (SHA-256 hex) on
`PhysicalHost.Status.Bootstrap`; plaintexts live only in the per-host Secret
`<hostName>-bootstrap-token` (owner-ref'd to the PhysicalHost, GC'd on delete)
and in host memory. See `internal/auth/token.go` for the primitives.

---

## 4. Endpoints

All three endpoints are served by the controller's callback server on a single
HTTPS listener (default `:8082`, `controllers/inspection_handler.go`
`SetupCallbackServer`). TLS is mandatory on all of them.

### 4.1 `GET /api/v1/boot/{namespace}/{hostName}/{nonce}` — boot-param rendering

- **Auth**: the `{nonce}` path segment, verified constant-time against
  `Status.Bootstrap.BootNonceHash`, within TTL, and **not yet consumed**
  (`Status.Bootstrap.BootNonceConsumedAt == nil`). NOT bearer-gated.
- **On success**: marks the nonce consumed (single-use, see §7) and returns the
  rendered iPXE script / kernel cmdline carrying the parameters in §5. A second
  successful fetch within the window (e.g. a NIC retry) MUST return **identical**
  content for the same host.
- **Failure**: opaque response identical for "no such host", "wrong nonce",
  "expired", and "already consumed" — no oracle. The nonce, the URL, and the
  `{nonce}` path value MUST NOT be logged (the nonce hash MAY be).
- **Rate limiting**: this route is ungated; it MUST be rate-limited per source IP
  (and SHOULD be per `{namespace}/{hostName}`).

**Rendered output** (`Content-Type: text/plain`): a complete iPXE script that
boots the inspector image with the §5 parameters on the kernel cmdline:

```ipxe
#!ipxe
kernel {InspectionImageURL}/vmlinuz beskar7.api={api} beskar7.namespace={ns} beskar7.host={host} beskar7.token={token} beskar7.target={target} beskar7.target-digest={digest} beskar7.ca={base64CA} [beskar7.disk={disk}] [BOOTIF={01-mac}] [beskar7.timeout={t}] [beskar7.debug=true]
initrd {InspectionImageURL}/initrd.img
boot
```

The operator's first-stage iPXE (the one that fetches this `/boot` URL after
DHCP+TFTP) SHOULD append the booting NIC's MAC as a `?mac=${net0/mac}` query
parameter. `/boot` validates it (a well-formed colon-MAC; a malformed value is
omitted, never rendered — no cmdline injection) and renders it as
`BOOTIF=01-<mac-with-dashes>` so the inspector configures the correct interface
on a multi-NIC host (§8.2). Omitted when no valid `mac` is supplied — the
inspector then uses its single NIC, or DHCP-races all links and applies the
gatewayed winner on a multi-NIC host (§8.2).

- `{InspectionImageURL}` is `Beskar7Machine.Spec.InspectionImageURL` (the
  consuming machine, resolved via the host's `ConsumerRef`) — the HTTPS base URL
  of a location serving the inspector `vmlinuz` and `initrd.img`. (Contract v1
  re-purposes this field as the inspector image base; it was previously
  declared-but-unused.) If it is empty, `/boot` returns the opaque failure — the
  host cannot be booted without an inspector image.
- `{base64CA}` is the callback CA, base64-encoded (see §5 / §8).
- `{target}` is `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageURL` (the Kairos whole-disk raw
  image URL) and `{digest}` is `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageDigest`
  (`sha256:<hex>`). Both are required spec fields; if either is empty, `/boot`
  returns the opaque failure — a host MUST NOT be booted without a pinned target.
- The script boots the inspector image directly; it does NOT chainload another
  iPXE script (the per-host script IS this response).

> **Implementation status (v2):** this section is **implemented** in this repo.
> `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageDigest` exists (required,
> `^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$`) and `buildBootIPXEScript` renders `beskar7.target` +
> `beskar7.target-digest`; `TargetImageURL`'s godoc is Kairos-correct. The
> *optional* `beskar7.disk` render shown in brackets above is also implemented:
> `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetDisk` (optional, `^[A-Za-z0-9._:/+-]+$`) is rendered
> by `/boot` immediately after `beskar7.ca` when set, and omitted when empty (the
> default auto-select path). The **inspector** deploy path (§9.1 step 5) is built
> in the inspector repo against this spec.

### 4.2 `POST /api/v1/inspection/{namespace}/{hostName}` — hardware report

- **Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the token's SHA-256 MUST match
  `Status.Bootstrap.TokenHash` and `ExpiresAt` MUST be in the future
  (`auth.RequireBearer` + `newBearerTokenVerifier`).
- **Body**: JSON, the `InspectionReportRequest` schema in §6. Max 1 MiB
  (`inspectionMaxBodyBytes`); over-limit → `413`.
- **Success**: **`202 Accepted`** with body `{"status":"accepted"}`. The 202 (not
  200) is deliberate — the report is stored and the reconciler signalled, but
  `Status.InspectionReport`/`InspectionPhase` are written asynchronously by the
  PhysicalHost reconciler (D-005). The inspector MUST treat **202** as success.
- `namespace`/`hostName` come from the URL path. The JSON body MAY also carry
  `namespace`/`hostName` for legacy compatibility but they are ignored.

### 4.3 `GET /api/v1/bootstrap/{namespace}/{hostName}` — CAPI bootstrap user-data

- **Auth**: same bearer token as §4.2.
- **Success**: `200` with the raw CAPI bootstrap user-data bytes
  (`Content-Type: application/octet-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-store`). This is
  the cloud-init/Ignition payload (the CAPI Secret `data["value"]`) — see
  `controllers/bootstrap_handler.go`. **It may contain cluster join secrets.**
- **Failure**: opaque `404` for every resolution-chain failure (host → ConsumerRef
  → Beskar7Machine → owner Machine → `Spec.Bootstrap.DataSecretName` → Secret);
  `500` only for an oversize secret.

## 5. Kernel cmdline parameters

Rendered by `/boot` into the inspector's kernel cmdline. The inspector parses
these from `/proc/cmdline`.

| Param | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `beskar7.api` | yes | Externally-reachable HTTPS base URL of the callback server (e.g. `https://beskar7.example.com:8082`). MUST NOT be a `*.svc` cluster-internal name (see §8). |
| `beskar7.namespace` | yes | PhysicalHost namespace (used in the endpoint paths). |
| `beskar7.host` | yes | PhysicalHost name. |
| `beskar7.token` | yes | The per-host bearer token (43-char `base64url`, no padding). Secret. |
| `beskar7.target` | yes | `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageURL` — the **Kairos whole-disk raw image** the inspector writes to the target disk. MUST be an `http://` or `https://` URL; plain HTTP is permitted (integrity comes from `beskar7.target-digest`, not TLS — see §8.1). Non-secret. |
| `beskar7.target-digest` | yes | `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageDigest` — the expected SHA-256 of the bytes at `beskar7.target`, matching `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$`. The inspector MUST verify the written image against this digest and MUST refuse to **boot** (mount/inject/reboot) a non-matching image (§8.1). Non-secret; it is the sole integrity **and authenticity** anchor for the OS image. |
| `beskar7.ca` | yes | Base64-encoded PEM of the CA the inspector uses to verify the callback's TLS cert. **Inline only.** `/boot` sources it from the manager's callback cert dir (`ca.crt` if present — cert-manager and the chart's self-signed path both provide it — else the self-signed `tls.crt`). Bounded by kernel cmdline length (~2–4 KiB): a single self-signed/issuer cert fits; a full multi-cert chain may not. A `beskar7.ca-url` fetch variant for chain delivery is deferred to a later contract version. See §8. Note: this CA verifies **only** the callback endpoints (`/inspection`, `/bootstrap`); it does NOT verify `beskar7.target` (§8.1). |
| `beskar7.disk` | no | Operator override pinning the target disk — a stable device path (`/dev/disk/by-id/...`, `/dev/disk/by-path/...`) or a kernel name (`/dev/nvme0n1`, `sda`). When **absent**, the inspector auto-selects the smallest eligible disk (§9.1 step 2). When **present**, the inspector MUST resolve it once to its canonical whole-disk kernel device (`/dev/<kname>`, following any `by-id`/`by-path` symlink) and thereafter use *that resolved node* for both validation and the write, so the device validated is the device written (no TOCTOU re-lookup). It MUST use exactly that device and MUST abort — never silently falling back to auto-selection (a wrong pin fails loudly) — if the device is missing, not a block device, **not a whole disk** (a partition, `dm`/loop, or other non-whole-disk node), removable, read-only, **backs the running ramdisk**, or is smaller than the image. Sourced from the optional `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetDisk` field, rendered by `/boot` after `beskar7.ca` when set. Non-secret. |
| `beskar7.timeout` | no | Inspector-side overall timeout (seconds). |
| `beskar7.debug` | no | `true` to enable verbose logging / debug shell on failure. |
| `BOOTIF` | no | The provisioning NIC's MAC in the pxelinux/iPXE form `01-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff` (a `01` hardware-type prefix + the MAC with dashes). **Not** a `beskar7.*` key — it is the established netboot convention. `/boot` renders it from a `?mac=<mac>` query the operator's first-stage iPXE appends (e.g. `${net0/mac}`); see §4.1, §8.2. The inspector DHCP-configures the matching interface. **Absent** → a single-NIC host uses its one NIC; a multi-NIC host DHCP-races all links and applies the gatewayed winner (§8.2). `BOOTIF` is the deterministic pin and is the way to select a specific network. Non-secret. |
| `beskar7.ip` | reserved | Planned static-network fallback for DHCP-less / VLAN-pinned environments, kernel-`ip=` syntax (`<ip>::<gw>:<mask>[:<dns>]`). Not rendered in v2 — DHCP is the only network mechanism (§8.2); reserved here so the name is not reused. |

The only **secret** on the cmdline is `beskar7.token`. This is acceptable for a
single-purpose, ephemeral, operator-controlled inspection ramdisk (see §8); the
inspector MUST NOT persist the cmdline to durable logs. The bearer token cannot
leak into the provisioned OS's persistent `/proc/cmdline` — v2 reboots via host
firmware (§9), so the target OS boots with its own cmdline carrying no `beskar7.*`
parameters.

---

## 6. Inspection report schema (wire format)

The POST body in §4.2. This is the authoritative JSON shape; the controller
decodes it into `InspectionReportRequest` (`controllers/inspection_handler.go`).
All fields are `omitempty`. Unknown fields are ignored.

```jsonc
{
  "manufacturer": "string",
  "model": "string",
  "serialNumber": "string",
  "bootModeDetected": "UEFI" | "Legacy",
  "firmwareVersion": "string",
  "cpus": [
    { "id": "string", "vendor": "string", "model": "string",
      "cores": 0, "threads": 0, "frequency": "string" }
  ],
  "memory": [
    { "id": "string", "type": "string", "capacity": "32GiB", "speed": "string" }
  ],
  "disks": [
    { "name": "string", "model": "string", "sizeGB": 0,
      "type": "HDD" | "SSD" | "NVMe", "serialNumber": "string" }
  ],
  "nics": [
    { "name": "string", "macAddress": "string", "driver": "string",
      "speed": "string", "ipAddresses": ["string"] }
  ]
}
```

### 6.1 Validation rules the inspector MUST satisfy

The controller validates the report against `Beskar7Machine.Spec.HardwareRequirements`
(`controllers/beskar7machine_controller.go`). To produce data the controller can
evaluate correctly:

- **CPU cores**: the controller sums `cpus[].cores` across the array for
  `MinCPUCores`. The inspector MUST emit one entry **per physical CPU package**
  with that package's real core count — NOT one entry per logical processor, and
  NOT the per-socket core count repeated. (The previous bash inspector got this
  wrong.)
- **Memory capacity**: `memory[].capacity` MUST carry a unit suffix the
  controller accepts: `GB`, `GiB`, `MB`, `MiB`, `TB`, or `TiB`
  (`parseMemoryCapacityGB`). A bare integer is rejected. Emit one entry per
  populated DIMM where SMBIOS Type 17 exposes it.
- **Disk size**: `disks[].sizeGB` is summed for `MinDiskGB`; emit integer GB.
- **NIC IPs**: `nics[].ipAddresses` MUST be a real JSON array of individual
  address strings — not a single comma-joined string.

---

## 7. Single-use semantics (boot nonce)

- The nonce is consumed on first successful `/boot` fetch by setting
  `Status.Bootstrap.BootNonceConsumedAt`. The consume MUST be atomic
  (optimistic-locked) so two concurrent fetches cannot both treat the nonce as
  fresh. Note: the existing inspection/bootstrap annotation writes deliberately
  drop optimistic locking (single unique writer); the consume is the opposite
  situation — a Conflict is the desired outcome and MUST be enforced.
- A double-fetch to the **same host** (race loser, or a legitimate retry) is
  benign and MUST return identical content (§4.1). A second fetch for a
  **different** host's nonce is impossible by construction (per-host nonce).
- Re-provision (reboot, inspection-timeout retry, delete-and-recreate) MUST mint
  a **fresh** nonce (and fresh bearer token) — there is no "un-consume" path.
- If the consume is routed through the D-005 annotation→reconciler handoff rather
  than a direct status write, single-use weakens to "single-use modulo reconcile
  lag"; this is acceptable only because the same-host response is idempotent. The
  direct-vs-handoff choice is an implementation decision (see §11).

---

## 8. TLS and reachability

- **All three endpoints are HTTPS-only.** The inspector MUST verify the callback
  server's certificate against the CA delivered inline via `beskar7.ca`.
  The inspector MUST NOT offer or use an insecure-skip-verify option for the
  inspection POST or bootstrap GET — those carry/return cluster join secrets and a
  MITM there is a cluster compromise. This mirrors the `RedfishConnection` posture
  where `InsecureSkipVerify` and `caBundleSecretRef` are mutually exclusive
  (`controllers/redfish_tls.go`).
- **External reachability**: the bare-metal host reaches the callback over an
  externally-routable address (LoadBalancer/NodePort/Ingress), NOT cluster DNS.
  `beskar7.api` MUST be that external address, and the callback serving cert MUST
  have a SAN covering it. The current `--bootstrap-url-base` default
  (`https://beskar7-controller-manager.beskar7-system.svc:8082`) is unreachable
  from bare metal and a `.svc`-only cert forces operators toward insecure-skip —
  operators MUST override it (the manager SHOULD warn at startup if it is a
  `.svc` name).
- **Chainload hop**: the operator's boot infrastructure serves the per-host iPXE
  script (containing the `/boot/...{nonce}` URL) and the kernel/initrd. That hop
  MUST be HTTPS — it carries the nonce in the clear otherwise, and a plain-HTTP
  kernel/initrd hop is an OS-image MITM. (Tracked: `docs/ipxe-setup.md` currently
  ships plain `http://` — SEC-6 must convert it in lockstep.)
- **TOFU on `/boot`**: the `/boot` fetch precedes the inspector having the CA (the
  CA is delivered by `/boot`), so that single request is trust-on-first-use for
  the callback cert. This is acceptable because `/boot` carries no host secret
  (the nonce is already on the wire by assumption) and the downstream POST/GET
  re-verify against the delivered CA. The inspector MUST NOT cache the TOFU cert
  as a trust anchor across boots.

### 8.1 Target-image integrity (digest pinning, not TLS)

The target OS image (`beskar7.target`) is a **distinct trust domain** from the
callback endpoints and is integrity-checked by **content digest**, not transport
security:

- The image MAY be served over plain HTTP. Its integrity **and authenticity**
  come entirely from `beskar7.target-digest` (`sha256:<hex>`, §5), which the
  inspector receives over the same verified-TLS-derived channel as the rest of the
  cmdline (rendered by `/boot`, whose nonce/CA chain is the trust root). The digest
  is the *only* thing binding the image bytes to the operator — there is no
  signature — so the operator MUST compute `beskar7.target-digest` over the exact
  artifact served at `beskar7.target` (a pinned, immutable image; never a mutable
  `latest`-style URL whose bytes can change out from under the digest).
- **Scheme and redirects.** `beskar7.target` MUST be an `http://` or `https://`
  URL. The inspector MUST reject any other scheme (`file://`, `unix://`, etc.) and
  MUST NOT follow a redirect that changes scheme or host to a non-`http(s)` target;
  the digest gate MUST hold across any redirect that is followed. This prevents a
  plain-HTTP MITM from redirecting the fetch to a local path or an internal address
  (SSRF) — the inspector has no webpki roots and cannot rely on TLS to stop it.
- The inspector's TLS trust store carries **only** the cmdline-delivered callback
  CA (§8) — it has **no** public webpki roots. It therefore cannot, and MUST NOT,
  attempt to verify a TLS certificate for an arbitrary operator image host. The
  image fetch MUST use the digest as its only integrity check.
- **Verification model (stream-to-disk, gate the reboot — not the write).** The
  image is a multi-GB whole-disk raw; the inspector MUST NOT buffer it in RAM/tmpfs.
  It streams the download directly to the target disk while computing the SHA-256
  incrementally over the same byte stream, then compares the computed digest to
  `beskar7.target-digest` with a full-length, exact byte comparison (constant-time
  is **not** required — the digest is public, not a secret) once the write
  completes. The integrity gate is on the **boot decision**, not the disk write:
  only a verified-matching digest permits the inspector to proceed to mount
  `COS_OEM`, inject the user-data, and reboot. On any mismatch, short read, or
  size-limit breach the inspector MUST abort — it MUST NOT mount the image, MUST
  NOT inject the user-data, and MUST NOT reboot the host. A digest-failed write
  leaves the disk unbootable **by design**: the host falls back to PXE and the next
  provisioning attempt mints a fresh nonce (§7) and overwrites the disk. (Writing
  the unverified bytes to disk is safe because the image carries no secret and the
  host never boots them.)
- **Size bound (DoS).** The inspector MUST enforce a maximum image size (a build
  default; no §5 cmdline override is defined in v2) and MUST abort the download
  once it is exceeded, rather than writing or hashing unbounded bytes. The bound
  SHOULD also be capped by the selected target disk's capacity (a whole-disk image
  larger than the disk can never deploy). A plain-HTTP MITM cannot forge the digest,
  but absent a bound it can serve an unbounded body to exhaust the target disk or
  stall provisioning — a pre-verification DoS.
- **Digest format.** `beskar7.target-digest` MUST match `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$`
  (lowercase-normalized before compare). The inspector MUST reject a malformed,
  truncated, or non-`sha256:` digest outright. Only `sha256:` is accepted in v2; a
  stronger or multi-digest scheme is a contract bump, not a silent client
  extension.
- This mirrors the image-handoff posture of Ironic / Metal³ / Tinkerbell, where
  the OS image is a public, non-secret artifact pinned by checksum rather than
  authenticated by TLS. It is acceptable **only** because the image carries no
  secret: the per-host secret (the CAPI join data) arrives separately via the
  verified-TLS `/bootstrap` GET and is injected locally (§9), never embedded in
  the published image.

### 8.2 Network bring-up (the inspector configures its own networking)

The §4 endpoints assume the inspector can reach `beskar7.api`, but the inspector
boots with the provisioning NIC **down and unaddressed**. It MUST therefore
configure networking itself, in Phase 1, **before** the inspection POST:

- **The kernel's `ip=` autoconfiguration MUST NOT be relied upon.** The inspector
  ships a minimal initramfs and loads NIC drivers as modules *after* boot (a
  packaging decision: the distro kernel builds them modular), which is past the
  kernel's ipconfig stage — so kernel-level DHCP cannot bring the link up. The
  inspector brings the link up and acquires an address itself.
- **DHCP is the network mechanism.** The inspector runs a one-shot DHCP exchange
  on the provisioning NIC (the provisioning network is, by construction, the
  DHCP/PXE environment the host already booted from), then applies the leased
  address + default route. No `dhclient`/`udhcpc` — it is done natively, in
  keeping with the single-purpose ramdisk.
- **NIC selection** is by `BOOTIF` (§5): the MAC of the interface that PXE-booted,
  which `/boot` renders from the operator iPXE's `?mac=` query (§4.1) — the
  deterministic pin and the recommended path. When `BOOTIF` is **absent**: a
  single-NIC host uses its one NIC; a **multi-NIC** host brings every link up,
  runs DHCP on all of them concurrently, and applies the winner — preferring a
  lease that carries a default gateway (that network routes toward `beskar7.api`),
  then the lowest-sorted interface name. Only the winner is left addressed; the
  losing links are brought back down. So a multi-NIC host can provision without
  `BOOTIF`, but `BOOTIF` removes the ambiguity (and is the way to pin a specific
  network when several offer gatewayed leases).
- **DNS / `beskar7.api` form.** The inspector writes the DHCP option-6 servers to
  `/etc/resolv.conf`, so a hostname `beskar7.api` resolves. Operators SHOULD
  nonetheless use an **IP-literal** `beskar7.api` (the controller renders one from
  the externally-reachable callback address per §8): a hostname additionally
  relies on the semi-trusted DHCP-supplied resolver. Confidentiality is unaffected
  either way — the downstream POST/GET still verify against the cmdline-delivered
  CA (§8.1), so a misdirected hostname **fails the TLS check** rather than leaking
  the join secret. When DHCP offers no option-6 servers, no `/etc/resolv.conf` is
  written and a hostname `beskar7.api` fails at the report POST — use an
  IP-literal.
- **Trust.** DHCP is unauthenticated and the provisioning L2 is **semi-trusted**:
  a rogue DHCP server can deny or misdirect provisioning (a DoS), but it CANNOT
  break join-secret confidentiality — that is gated by the verified-TLS
  `/bootstrap` GET against the cmdline-delivered CA (§8), not by the network. This
  is the same residual the boot-nonce L2 exposure already accepts (§11).

Deferred (§11): a `beskar7.ip=` static fallback for DHCP-less / VLAN-pinned
networks; VLAN-tagged provisioning networks.

## 9. Inspector required behavior (client contract)

### 9.0 Role of the inspector

The inspector is the **only in-band component** in a Beskar7 provisioning cycle —
the one piece of Beskar7 that runs *on* the bare-metal host. The BMC/Redfish
channel does power and boot-source control only (out-of-band); the controller
runs in the management cluster (out-of-band). Everything that requires being
inside the host — reading firmware inventory, choosing a disk, writing the OS,
planting the join secret — is the inspector's job. Without it, Beskar7 is a
netboot installer, not a Cluster API infrastructure provider.

The inspector has exactly three irreducible responsibilities, run in **two
phases**:

- **Phase 1 — Enroll & inspect (always).** Parse the cmdline, probe hardware from
  firmware truth, select a target disk, and POST the report. This populates
  `PhysicalHost.Status`, lets the controller gate `HardwareRequirements`, and
  records which disk will be written. Phase 1 is idempotent and side-effect-free
  on the host's disks.
- **Phase 2 — Provision (only when bootstrap data is ready).** Fetch the CAPI
  bootstrap user-data, write the digest-pinned target image to the selected disk,
  inject a per-host config embedding that user-data into the image's `COS_OEM`
  partition, and reboot the host into the provisioned OS. Phase 2 is the only
  destructive phase and the only one that handles the join secret.

`--dry-run` runs **Phase 1 only** (steps 1–3 below), making no destructive change
and never rebooting — this is the CI / report-only mode.

### 9.1 Required steps

The inspector MUST:

1. Parse the §5 cmdline params from `/proc/cmdline`, then **bring up the
   provisioning network** (§8.2): load the NIC driver, select the interface by
   `BOOTIF` (or the single NIC, or by DHCP-racing all links on a multi-NIC host),
   DHCP for an address, apply the leased address + default route, and write any
   DHCP-supplied DNS to `/etc/resolv.conf` — so the callback is reachable for step
   3. (`--dry-run` skips network bring-up; the CI host is already networked.)
2. Probe hardware natively (SMBIOS/DMI via `/sys/firmware/dmi/tables`, plus `/sys`
   and `/proc`) and build the §6 report satisfying §6.1. **Select the target disk**:
   if `beskar7.disk` is set, resolve it once to its canonical whole-disk kernel node
   (§5) and use exactly that device — aborting if it is missing, not a block device,
   not a whole disk (partition/`dm`/loop), removable, read-only, backs the running
   ramdisk, or smaller than the image, and never silently falling back; otherwise
   auto-select the **smallest** whole disk large enough to hold the image (and meeting
   `MinDiskGB`), excluding partitions, removable/USB media, read-only devices, and any
   device backing the running ramdisk. The inspector MUST log (non-secret) which disk
   it chose and why, and MUST refuse to provision if no disk qualifies.
3. `POST` the report to `{api}/api/v1/inspection/{ns}/{host}` with the bearer
   token over verified TLS; treat **202** as success; retry transient failures
   with backoff.
4. *(Phase 2)* `GET` `{api}/api/v1/bootstrap/{ns}/{host}` with the same bearer
   token over verified TLS to fetch the CAPI user-data.
5. *(Phase 2)* Deploy the OS to the selected disk:
   1. Stream `beskar7.target` (scheme/redirect-restricted per §8.1) directly to the
      selected target disk, computing its SHA-256 incrementally and enforcing the
      §8.1 maximum-size bound. The inspector MUST NOT buffer the whole image in
      RAM/tmpfs.
   2. After the write completes, verify the computed digest against
      `beskar7.target-digest` (full-length exact compare, §8.1). On mismatch, short
      read, or size-limit breach the inspector MUST abort: it MUST NOT mount,
      inject, or reboot — the unbootable disk is recovered on the next provisioning
      attempt (§7, §8.1).
   3. Re-read the partition table of the **selected target disk** and locate the
      `COS_OEM` partition **by enumerating that disk's own partitions only** — NOT by a
      system-wide filesystem-label scan. The inspector MUST find the partition whose
      `COS_OEM` filesystem label lives on a partition node whose parent block device is
      the selected target disk, and MUST verify that parentage before mounting. If the
      target disk has no `COS_OEM` partition after the image write, the inspector MUST
      abort — it MUST NOT search other disks or mount a `COS_OEM` belonging to a
      different device (an attacker-supplied or pre-existing disk could otherwise carry
      a `COS_OEM` label and capture the join secret). Mount the verified partition with
      `nodev,nosuid,noexec` and write the fetched user-data as a single **numbered
      Kairos cloud-config file**, `99_beskar7.yaml`, on it. The `99_` prefix orders it
      after the image's baked-in OEM configs so the per-host config takes precedence.
      The file content MUST be a valid Kairos cloud-config; v2 assumes the CAPI
      bootstrap provider emits Kairos-compatible cloud-config (the `#cloud-config` +
      `stages`/`write_files` shape), so the inspector **places** the user-data rather
      than transcoding it (transforming arbitrary cloud-init/Ignition is a §11
      follow-up). The user-data MUST be written **only** to the verified target
      `COS_OEM` partition — never to the ramdisk's durable storage or logs — and the
      written file MUST be root-owned with mode `0600`.
   4. `fsync` the written file **and** its containing directory, unmount the `COS_OEM`
      partition, **zero the in-memory user-data buffer**, then `reboot(2)`. The
      `COS_OEM` partition MUST be unmounted before `reboot(2)` on every path. The host
      firmware boots the provisioned OS; Kairos applies the injected config on first
      boot. (`kexec` is an optional future speed optimization — see §11 — not a
      contract requirement.)
   5. **Failure cleanup.** If any step *after* mounting `COS_OEM` fails (write,
      `fsync`, or a later abort), the inspector MUST remove the partial
      `99_beskar7.yaml` and unmount `COS_OEM` before dropping to the debug shell or
      rebooting — it MUST NOT leave the join secret on a mounted-then-abandoned
      partition or in the partial file. The user-data buffer MUST still be zeroed on
      this path.
6. Never log the bearer token, the nonce, the cmdline, or the bootstrap/user-data
   bytes. The inspector MUST NOT let the bearer token or the user-data/join secret
   reach swap or any durable medium: the ramdisk MUST run swapless, or the inspector
   MUST `mlock` and zero those buffers.
7. Provide a `--dry-run` / report-only mode that performs steps 1–3 (Phase 1) and
   then exits **without** fetching bootstrap data, writing any disk, or rebooting
   (for CI without real firmware or a real target disk).

### 9.2 Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition (bootstrap readiness)

The bootstrap user-data is produced asynchronously by the CAPI bootstrap provider
and is **not** guaranteed to exist when the inspector finishes Phase 1. The
`/bootstrap` endpoint returns an **opaque `404`** for the not-ready case *and* for
genuine resolution failures (§4.3) — it gives the inspector no oracle to tell them
apart. The inspector therefore MUST treat the GET as a **poll**, not a one-shot:

- A `404` (or `5xx`) on `GET /bootstrap` means **not ready yet**: the inspector
  MUST retry with backoff, not abort. A `200` carrying user-data is the signal to
  enter Phase 2 (step 5).
- The inspector MUST bound the poll by `beskar7.timeout` (or a build default). On
  timeout it MUST NOT write the disk; it exits to the debug shell (if
  `beskar7.debug`) or powers the behaviour off to a non-destructive failure that
  the controller observes as an inspection/provisioning timeout (it re-mints a
  fresh nonce + token on the next attempt, §7).
- A `401`/`403` is **not** retryable the same way — it indicates an expired or
  wrong bearer token (the 30-min token lifetime, §3); the inspector MUST abort
  rather than spin (the controller must re-provision with a fresh token).
- The inspector holds no durable state between attempts: a timed-out host is
  re-driven by the controller (re-PXE → fresh nonce/token → re-inspect), not by
  the inspector retrying across reboots. There is no in-ramdisk persistence of the
  poll position.

## 10. Versioning and anti-drift

- This document carries a **contract version** (top of file). Both repos record
  the version they implement.
- A **golden report fixture** (a canonical §6 JSON document) lives in both repos.
  The canonical copy is [`test/contract/golden_inspection_report.json`](../test/contract/golden_inspection_report.json)
  (see [`test/contract/README.md`](../test/contract/README.md)). The controller test
  `controllers/inspection_contract_test.go` decodes it into `InspectionReportRequest`
  — both leniently (production parity) and strictly (`DisallowUnknownFields`, the
  forward-drift catch) — round-trips it to prove the struct is lossless, runs
  `buildInspectionReport`, and runs the real `parseMemoryCapacityGB` over its memory
  entries to lock the hardware-aggregate math. The inspector mirrors the same bytes
  in a serde round-trip test asserting byte-equivalent JSON. A schema change on
  either side fails one or both tests, forcing a coordinated contract bump.
- **The deploy path (Phase 2) is NOT covered by the golden fixture.** The fixture
  locks only the §6 *report* wire format. v2's destructive disk behavior — digest
  verification, `COS_OEM` injection, the cmdline render of `beskar7.target-digest`
  — has no equivalent byte-locked test and is a separate drift surface. At minimum
  it MUST be guarded by: a controller-side test that `/boot` renders
  `beskar7.target-digest` from `Beskar7MachineSpec.TargetImageDigest`; an inspector
  test asserting a digest mismatch aborts before mount/inject/reboot; a fixture
  for the injected `COS_OEM` cloud-config shape; and an inspector test that a
  pinned-but-ineligible `beskar7.disk` aborts with **no** fallback while
  auto-selection picks the smallest eligible whole disk, excluding the
  ramdisk-backing device (§9.1 step 2). Until those land, "no test failed"
  does **not** imply the deploy contract held (e.g. a changed OEM filename
  convention, or a regression to a system-wide `COS_OEM` label scan, would pass
  silently).

### 10.1 Version history

| Version | Delta |
|---|---|
| **v1** | Initial frozen contract: boot-nonce + bearer-token two-secret trust model, three HTTPS endpoints (`/boot`, `/inspection`, `/bootstrap`), §6 inspection report schema + golden fixture, inline `beskar7.ca`. Handoff was **kexec into `beskar7.target`** (a kernel+initrd image). |
| **v2** | **Handoff redesign — §6 report schema unchanged.** Replaces kexec with whole-disk image deployment: the inspector writes a Kairos whole-disk raw image (`beskar7.target`) to the target disk, injects the per-host config (with CAPI user-data) as a numbered Kairos cloud-config (`99_beskar7.yaml`) into the image's `COS_OEM` partition, and reboots. Adds required cmdline param `beskar7.target-digest` (`sha256:<hex>`) plus optional `beskar7.disk` (operator disk-selection override), the §8.1 digest-pinning trust model (target image over plain HTTP, integrity by content digest, not TLS), and a specified disk-selection policy (smallest eligible disk by default). Reframes §9 around the two-phase enroll/provision role model (§9.0–9.2). **Report path:** the §6 schema and golden fixture are untouched, so the bump forces **no** inspector report-code or fixture change. **Controller side:** the CRD delta is **implemented** in this repo — the required `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetImageDigest` field and the `/boot` render of `beskar7.target` + `beskar7.target-digest`, plus the optional `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetDisk` field and its `beskar7.disk` render. The inspector deploy path (§9.1 step 5) is a new, separately-tested drift surface (§10). |

## 11. Deferred and open items

- **Redfish virtual-media nonce delivery** (future hardening): delivering the boot
  nonce out-of-band via the BMC (BIOS attribute / virtual media) would remove the
  pre-consumption L2 exposure entirely, but requires per-vendor virtual-media
  support that does not exist in `internal/redfish/` today. Revisit only if a
  non-single-purpose provisioning OS reuses the cmdline-token channel.
- **Consume mechanism** (implementation decision for Phase A): direct
  `Status.Bootstrap.BootNonceConsumedAt` write under optimistic lock (strong
  single-use, but the handler writing status is a D-005 exception needing
  sign-off) vs. an annotation→reconciler handoff (D-005-clean, single-use modulo
  reconcile lag). The same-host idempotent response (§7) makes either acceptable.
- **MAC learning** (optional, additive): Beskar7 MAY pin the provisioning-NIC MAC
  into status on first boot / from `InspectionReport.NICs` for inventory. It MUST
  NOT become a required spec field (it duplicates the operator's DHCP mapping and
  is not a trust anchor).
- **Operator-pinned target disk** (implemented): §5/§9.1 specify disk selection —
  the smallest eligible disk by default, or an explicit `beskar7.disk` override.
  The inspector honors `beskar7.disk`, and the controller now renders it from the
  optional `Beskar7Machine.Spec.TargetDisk` field (`/boot`, after `beskar7.ca`,
  only when set). It is **not** required for default (auto-select) provisioning.
- **Network bring-up breadth** (additive, §8.2): implemented so far — DHCP with
  `BOOTIF` selection, the no-`BOOTIF` multi-NIC "DHCP every link and race"
  (gatewayed-lease preference), and the DHCP-option-6 → `/etc/resolv.conf` writer
  that lets `beskar7.api` be a hostname (IP-literal still recommended). Still
  deferred: a `beskar7.ip=` static-network fallback (the §5-reserved param, plus
  an optional `Beskar7Machine` spec field to render it — YAGNI until a real
  static-network requirement lands) and VLAN-tagged provisioning networks. Each is
  additive — the inspector's single network-bring-up entry point absorbs them
  without changing the Phase-1 flow.
- **kexec for boot-time speed** (future optimization): v2 reboots via host
  firmware (one POST cycle). A later version MAY `kexec` directly into the freshly
  written OS to skip the firmware POST, but kexec needs real firmware and a
  vendor-portable kernel/initrd extraction path; it is an optimization, never a
  correctness requirement, and is out of scope for v2.
- **Generic (non-Kairos) whole-disk images** (future): v2's OEM-injection step is
  Kairos-specific (it relies on the `COS_OEM` label and Kairos's numbered
  cloud-config convention). Supporting a generic cloud-image (cloud-init seed via
  a `cidata` ISO / config-drive partition instead of `COS_OEM`) is a future
  variant and would be a contract bump, as it changes how the per-host user-data
  is injected.
- **Non-Kairos bootstrap user-data → Kairos-config transcoding** (open design): v2
  fixes the injection *mechanism* — the inspector writes the fetched user-data as a
  numbered Kairos cloud-config (`99_beskar7.yaml`) on `COS_OEM` (§9.1 step 5.3) — and
  assumes a Kairos "standard" (k3s/k0s-baked) image paired with a bootstrap provider
  that emits Kairos-compatible cloud-config. Transcoding raw cloud-init/Ignition from
  a generic CAPI bootstrap provider into Kairos stages is **not** done in v2; pairing
  Beskar7 with a Kairos-native bootstrap provider must be validated before the
  end-to-end join path is claimed working.
- **Provisioning-failure recovery** (open design, controller-side): §8.1 covers the
  digest-mismatch abort, but the contract does not yet specify how a host that
  fails *after* a successful inspection — `dd` write error, `COS_OEM` mount/inject
  failure, or an image that writes cleanly but never boots into a joining node — is
  detected and re-driven. The inspector is stateless across reboots (§9.2), so
  recovery is necessarily controller-side: an inspection/provisioning-timeout that
  re-mints a fresh nonce + token (§7) and re-PXEs, or operator delete/recreate.
  Because the success signal is out-of-band (§2), the controller's only handle on
  "provisioned but not joining" is a timeout — its bound and the retry policy are
  unspecified in v2 and must be defined before GA.
